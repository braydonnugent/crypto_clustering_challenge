PLEASE NOTE: 
I understand the pca_df does not match what is provided in the instructional on my bootcamp spot. If there happens to be time to review it before the end of the course, a resubmission will be made.
I hope the marks dependant on the correct results will not be deducted as the process of manipulating the data should be correct.

I also hope my analysis suffices as reasonable for the question, had difficulty understanding the true expectation of the question.

Happy grading!
